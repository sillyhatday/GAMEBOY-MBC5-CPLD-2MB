## Power use:

Power usage vs Nintendo carts vs DIY carts.

Power use so far seems to fall inline with the EZ flash Jr. This is unfortunate, but logical as the EZ Flash uses the same PLD/FPGA technology. Overall based on measurments takenm, the CPLD memory mapper looks to use 45 to 47mA more current than a regular cart. I intend to eventually measure cartridge current alone and not whole system current. This should remove any differences in hardware silicon and hardware revisions.

These are some rough current measurements taken at the battery terminals of a Bucket Mouse DMGC and a stock DMG. These are done with the screen on max brightness and no sound. Pokemon Blue and Red were used interchangeably, as they are virtually the same game.

For projected battery life in hours [Batt] it is in reference to the Duracell 2450mAh ones I use for Gameboy gaming. It is calculated based on mWh (11760mWh) to eliminate the voltage decrease as capacity is used. The mWh was calculated using the duracell datasheet for mAh and nominal voltage. Discharge rates were ignored as these batteries have an excellent ability to maintain capacity under high loads (1C, 2C, etc). Between 1C and 0.1C is about 5% difference.
